    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and sliced 1/8-inch thick with peel</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>4 ounces Gruyere cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.</li>
      <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic; 
        cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in flour;
         cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Whisk in heavy cream, milk, and salt until smooth. 
         Add sliced potatoes and bring to a simmer; cook, gently stirring occasionally, 
         until potatoes begin to soften, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in thyme and pepper.</li>
      <li>Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the prepared baking dish; sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese evenly over potatoes. 
        Top with remaining potatoes and spoon remaining liquid left in the pot over the potatoes. Top with remaining 1/2 cup cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven until sauce is thickened, top is browned in spots, and potatoes are tender, 40 to 45 minutes. 
        Let stand 15 minutes before serving; garnish with additional thyme.</li>
